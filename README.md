// Assignment 1: Alternating disks problem, left-to-right algorithm  
// Jose Urrutia  
// Given 2n alternating disks (dark, light) the program reads the number of single color disks  
// (light or dark), arranges the disks in the correct order and outputs the number of swaps  
// INPUT: a positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of alternating colors dark-light, starting with dark  
// OUTPUT: a list of 2n disks, the first n disks are light, the next n disks are dark, and an integer m representing the number of moves to move the dark ones after the light ones
